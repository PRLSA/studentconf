    <h2>What is This Symposium?</h2>
    <p>
        The 2023 Postgraduate Research Symposium on Linguistics and Language Data Analytics, to be collocated with PACLIC 2023 from Dec 2nd to Dec 5th, aims to offer an inter-institutional platform for local and international postgraduate students and
 
        researchers in linguistics-related fields using data-driven approaches and methodologies. They are cordially invited and encouraged to:
        •  Discuss their current progress and prospective work in their interested topics,
        •  Share their experience and expertise in undertaking data-driven research,
        •  Exchange innovative ideas about language data acquisition and language source construction,
        •  Communicate  with  our  invited  scholars  about  low-resource  language, language typology, and the representation of formal grammar in natural language processing and psycholinguistics.
        The essential objective of this  symposium is to encourage novel ideas from the next generation   of   researchers,   inter-institutional   and    inter-disciplinary   contacts,   and collaborations among UGC and non-UGC-funded university research students. The fields of interest include but are not limited to the application of Corpus Linguistics in Lexical Semantics,  Natural  Language  Processing,  the  linguistic  probe  of  Computational Language Models, Language Resource Construction, Cognitive Language Processing, Ontology, Metaphor, and Data Humanities.
        Our proposed student symposium will last for three days. Two seminar series will help  attendees  identify  research  topics  and  address  the  research-related  difficulties encountered  by  research   students.  During  the  two  seminar  events,  Prof.Yang  and Prof.Lori,  two  of  the  most  top-level  and  productive  researchers  in  both  language technologies  and  theoretic  linguistics,  will  be   invited  to  give  academic  talks  to postgraduate students invited from local or nonlocal universities, sharing their research experience in multilingual language data analysis, the probing of generative linguistics in distributional language representation, and the conservation of endangered languages using artificial intelligence.
